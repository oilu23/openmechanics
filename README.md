openmechanics 
======
New repo updated Nov 2017 to prepare for future github pages:)
*Please forgive me for any grammer errors:(*

openmechanics project was founded for one purpose only and that is turning any car into self-driving car well that’s the plan. The open source software for self-driving cars already exists and it is called  [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). I have been following openpilot ever since it was lunched but due to the nature of needing car with sensors and hacking CAN bus not all were supported until a genius did the impossible and his name is [vntarasov]( https://www.zoneos.com/galant.htm).

Vntarasov was able to use openpilot with regular car with just hydraulic power steering using actuators which inspired be to work on this project. After reading through comma’s forum and github repo, I was not alone who wanted to make NEO work on old cars. I have been doing research myself for couple of weeks now but decided to just open source the project so I won’t be alone on figuring out a solution. Big thanks to latimer for working on his upcoming [NeoMC  board]( http://openboards.io/2017/07/20/whats-to-come/) which will be used for all of the old cars support for NEO.

So the software[openpilot] is here( https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) and [NeoMC  board]( http://openboards.io) is almost here so the only thing that was left was an open source mechanical solution to make self-driving cars dreams become reality. The vision for the project is to have a kit that can be installed on almost any of the car which won’t be easy but anything is possible when bunch of geeks are involved. Following I will be sharing my plan:

The plan is to build a solution which will keep existing safety for cars.
